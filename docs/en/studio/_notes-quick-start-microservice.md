{
    "Description": "Quickly set up a microservice solution with our aligned wizard steps, guiding you through templates, frameworks, and configurations."
}
```

* Create new solution -> Microservice dialog
  * Wizard steps are not aligned with the application template. True order can be: Solution Template -> Solution Properties -> UI Framework -> Mobile Framework -> Database Provider -> Database Configurations -> UI Theme -> Optional Modules (if we change that, the document flow should also be updated)
